# Editor Themes With Blue Background #

This is a collection of editor/IDE themes or settings that have blue backgrounds in the code editing area.

Blue backgrounds work well on:

* **matte** and **glossy** displays (you don't see your reflection on glossy displays like you do with dark backgrounds)
* **dark** and **light** editor/IDE themes
* with **color temperature shifting** enabled via [f.lux](https://justgetflux.com/) or Apple's [Night Shift](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207513)
* Day and night.  It's not too bright and it's not too dark.

And if you loved Word Perfect 5.1 for DOS and/or the various DOS IDE/editors back in the day, you'll appreciate it.

* This will work in all JetBrains IDEs, though may need additional tweaks for some languages.

**NOTE:** This is *buggy*, and there are strange artifacts.  But if you prefer blue backgrounds, it's better than not having it.

VSCode has one setting to set the background, which is separate from theme configuration, and various themes will work well with this.  I found [OceanDeep](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=pierrenel.theme-oceandeep) to work well with this, but I may try other themes.  Note that the setting is experimental and will probably go away in a future release when they add custom themes.
